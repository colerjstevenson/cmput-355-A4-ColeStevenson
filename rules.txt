31 where each player gets 3 cards and the goal is to have the highest hand.

A hands score is calculated by adding up the value of all the cards of the 
same suit, where Aces are worth 11, face cards are worth 10, and all other 
cards are there obvious value.

so for example the hand:

Ace of Hearts
8 of Clubs 
2 of Hearts

would have a score of 13

At the beginning of the game each player is given 3 cards and the rest of 
the deck in put in to the draw pile. The top card in deck is then placed face
up to start the discard pile

Each turn a player may take a card from the top of either the deck or the 
discard pile and discard one of there cards to the top of the discard pile; or
if they believe there hand is good enough they may "knock", in which case the 
round automatically ends and the players all compare hands.

The winner is the player with the highest hand. In the case of a tie, the player
that knocked loses.
